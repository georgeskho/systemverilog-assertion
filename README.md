# systemverilog-assertion

This repository includes SVA, system verilog assertion, source codes as an example for my personal exmeriment.  
Most of the directories under this repository has SV or SVA source codes including DO-File (*.do) to run them on Questa-sim with the following commands:

<pre>
> vlib work
> vsim -do compile.do
</pre>
